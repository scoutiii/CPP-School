"So who are you going to ask to homecoming?"
I look up from my lunch, I was lost in thought.
It was James Adams, my best friend since middle school.
He's short with blond hair and almost always wears a suit.

"Oh gosh, I don't know..." I reply, "How about you?"

"Probably Kara." says James while he starts to dig into his school lunch.

My other best friend comes and sits down, a larger kid named Brian.
He became friends with James and I just last year.

"How about you?" I ask Brian.

"I've been thinking about asking Katie. You?"

"Im split right now between Cynthia and Charlotte..."

Cynthia is a taller than average girl, about 5' 10".
She has long blonde hair and bright blue eyes.
I've known her since middle school but we don't talk a whole lot, she is also a junior.
She is in band and plays the trumpet, the only girl trumpet in both jazz and symphonic band.

Charlotte isn't as tall, only about 5' 7".
She has long brown hair with grayish green eyes.
Apperantly she went to my middle school and is a senior now.
Also in band, but plays the clarient instead.

1. Cynthia
2. Charlotte
