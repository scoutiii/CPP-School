Let me get you up to speed.

My name is Charles Rose, im 19, going to college at University of Utah.
I like dogs, music, and math.
And I wanted to let you guys into my mind.
I have OCD.

For those of you who don't know, OCD stands for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.
It's not just liking to have a clean and organized desk.
Yes, I like things to be clean and organized on my desk.
And yes, I am a slight germaphobe.
But that is not what it's like to have OCD.

I think we'll start a couple of years ago... junior year of high school.
