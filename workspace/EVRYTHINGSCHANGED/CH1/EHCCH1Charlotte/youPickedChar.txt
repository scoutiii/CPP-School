"You know, I think im going to ask Charlotte."  after a moment of thought.

James and Brian pass one of those looks, they know I've liked her for quite a while now.

"BIG MOOOOOOOVESSS!!!!!!" they shout in unison.

The commotion subsides and we continue with our lives and lunches.
Little knowing how one seemingly simple choice can change the paradigm of an individual.

Thats just a fancy way of saying I kind of got fucked up because of her.


After the dance Charlotte started eating lunch with us more and more.
It didn't take long for her to break up with her boy friend and start hanging with me.
We kissed after the second date, made out after the thrid.
We were nearly inseperable, couldn't find one with out the other.
We texted every day, every class, every chance we had.

She joined our group of friends...
But with her coming in, made James leave.

Lost my best friend just for some temporary pleasure?!
And it was temporary.

You see, she was a senior, I was a junior.

It was summer, we spent nearly all day together.
I was seriously considering living the rest of my life with her.

But that didn't happen.


It started with the break up.
We both knew that it had to happen eventually.
But when she did it so soon......
I was crushed.
Destroyed
Confused

Sad...

But that wasn't the nail in the coffin.

She wouldn't leave my life, my mind, my spirit.
She wanted to be friends.
She even visited me once just so we could make out.

Like what the fuck!
She wouldn't let me go!!
How was I supposed to move on?!

It didn't take long before every memory we had together to get corrupted.
Every happy moment I had had in the last 6 short months were gone.
And when you're young and in love... it feels like a life time.
Like we had always been together.

Every laugh
Every kiss
Every hug
Every tear
Every emotion

It was all destroyed...


What
Had 
I
Done 
Wrong?
